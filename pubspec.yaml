  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/home_ilustration.png
    - assets/images/banner_placeholder.png
    - assets/icons/maki_doctor-11.png
    - assets/icons/ic_kontak_darurat.png
    - assets/icons/ic_layanan_time.png
    - assets/icons/ic_temui_kami.png
    - assets/key/kp-likvcc-55d8760cde3e.json

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Raleway
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/raleway/Raleway-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/raleway/Raleway-Light.ttf
          weight: 300
        - asset: assets/fonts/raleway/Raleway-SemiBold.ttf
    - family: Poppins
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/poppins/Poppins-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/poppins/Poppins-Light.ttf
          weight: 300
        - asset: assets/fonts/poppins/Poppins-SemiBold.ttf
